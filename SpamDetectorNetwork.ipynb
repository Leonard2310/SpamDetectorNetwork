The model preparation involves replacing the classification layer (Linear) with a sequence comprising a ReLU activation layer, a Dropout layer, and a linear layer. Additionally, the training of the network's feature extraction layers is frozen to retain the pre-trained weights and focus on fine-tuning the classification task."
